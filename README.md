I’m a Senior Developer Support Engineer at Cloudinary.
I help developers ship faster by turning confusing bugs into clear solutions and broken media pipelines into smooth, optimized workflows.

I live at the intersection of code, empathy, and pixels—debugging APIs, optimizing images & video, and translating complex problems into human-friendly answers.

If it involves SDKs, performance, or “why does this work locally but not in prod?”, I’m probably into it.
Develop custom SQL queries and scripts (Python, Shell).
Collaborate with engineering teams on feature reviews and SDK improvements.
Create and maintain internal Ops tools. 

My superpowers include:

Reading stack traces like mystery novels.

Making images and videos faster than you thought possible.

Saying “this is expected behavior” and actually meaning it.

Powered by APIs, logs, and just enough coffee.
